# Gender differences in autoimmune myasthenia gravis: Data from the German Myasthenia Gravis Registry


- DOI: _to be filled_


## Key points

- **Question**: Can machine learning (ML) models identify and characterize sex-specific phenotypic differences in autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) based on clinical and sociodemographic parameters?


- **Findings**: In this cross-sectional study of 1814 MG patients, ML models accurately estimated patient sex using seven clinical variables. This revealed a reproducible, nuanced sex-specific MG phenotype, externally validated. The analysis highlighted how clinical presentations vary significantly by sex, beyond what traditional comparisons typically show.

- **Meaning**: Our study demonstrates ML's ability to elucidate sex-related heterogeneity in MG beyond classical comparisons. Recognizing these distinct phenotypes can inform more precise diagnostics and individualized management, fostering equitable patient care.


## Installation

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate env_myaReg
```

_Please note that BorutaPy is no longer maintained and therefore requires an older version of numpy and scikit-learn; a seperate env for BorutaPy is advised_
