# Gender differences in autoimmune myasthenia gravis: Data from the German Myasthenia Gravis Registry


- DOI: _to be filled_


## Key points

- **Question**: Are there gender-specific differences in clinical and/or paraclinical characteristics among patients with autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG)?

- **Findings**: In this cross-sectional study that included 1814 MG patients, women showed significantly higher disease severity, longer time to diagnosis and less likelihood of positive antibody- and electrophysiological testing. Using a subset of seven variables, gender can be accurately predicted by machine learning models. This illustrates the strong gender differences between MG patients. Examining the decision making process of models more in detail enabled us to delineate the dominant clinical manifestation of female MG patients. 

- **Meaning**: Gender-specific differences in autoimmune MG encompass clinical and paraclinical factors and might influence time to diagnosis as well as therapeutic response.
